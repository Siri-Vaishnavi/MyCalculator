# MyCalculator
I developed a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring an interactive interface with buttons for arithmetic operations and a display screen for inputs and results. I used CSS Grid for layout and implemented event listeners, conditional statements, and operators to handle user input and perform calculations effectively.
